    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>My name is Yufei Chu. I am a research scientist at the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, Stony Brook University. My research focuses on atmospheric sensing using lidar, the spatiotemporal distribution of the boundary layer and its driving factors, as well as advanced environmental sensing technologies, such as fiber optics and non-destructive testing.</p>

    <p>Our team uses ground-based and airborne lidar to measure aerosols, atmospheric water vapor, temperature, wind speed, wind direction, polarization, and other parameters. We integrate these measurements with collaborative observations from ARM, including sounding, ECOR, EBBR, and AERI data, to investigate the spatiotemporal evolution of the boundary layer and its driving mechanisms. Our goal is to contribute to the improved parameterization of boundary layers in atmospheric models.</p>

    <p>Currently, our efforts are focused on:</p>
    <div class="research-directions">
        <p>1) Researching novel atmospheric sensing technologies, such as vehicle-mounted and airborne Raman and Doppler lidars.</p>
        <p>2) Exploring the spatiotemporal evolution of the boundary layer and its influencing factors.</p>
        <p>3) Developing new environmental sensing techniques, including fiber optics and non-destructive testing.</p>
        <p>4) Applying machine learning to meteorological data processing, particularly in boundary layer studies.</p>
