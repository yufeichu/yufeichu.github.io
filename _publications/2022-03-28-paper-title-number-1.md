PBL plays a critical role in the atmosphere by transferring heat, moisture, and momentum. The warm PBL has a distinct diurnal cycle, including daytime convective mixing layer (ML) and nighttime residual layer developments. For PBL characterization and process studies, simultaneous determinations of PBL height (PBLH) and ML height (MLH) are necessary. In this study, new approaches are developed to provide reliable PBLH and MLH measurements to characterize the warm PBL evolution. The approaches utilize Raman lidar (RL) water vapor mixing ratio (WVMR) and Doppler lidar (DL) vertical velocity measurements from the Southern Great Plains (SGP) atmospheric observatory, established by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) user facility. Compared to widely used lidar aerosol measurements for PBLH, WVMR provides a better trace for PBL vertical mixing.
