The water vapor transport associated with latent heat flux (LE) in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) is critical for the atmospheric hydrological cycle, radiation balance, and cloud formation. However, the spatiotemporal variability of LE and water vapor mixing ratio (rv) is poorly understood due to the scale-dependent and nonlinear atmospheric transport responses to land surface heterogeneity. In this study, airborne in situ measurements, utilizing the wavelet technique, are employed to investigate scale-dependent relationships among LE, vertical velocity variance (σw²), and water vapor variance (σH₂O²) over a heterogeneous surface during the Chequamegon Heterogeneous Ecosystem Energy-balance Study Enabled by a High-density Extensive Array of Detectors 2019 (CHEESEHEAD19) field campaign. The findings reveal distinct scale distributions of LE and the variances of σw² and σH₂O², providing new insights into how surface heterogeneity influences latent heat flux in the PBL.
