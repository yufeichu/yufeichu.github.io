The output from a fiber-optic interferometric ultrasonic sensor can be affected by operating point changes and/or optical power fluctuations. This paper reports a method for real-time, in situ calibration of the sensor's response to ultrasound-induced phase delays for a low-finesse Fabryâ€“Perot (FP) ultrasonic sensor demodulated using a phase-generated carrier. The carrier is produced by an electro-optic phase modulator, yielding two quadrature signals. The same phase modulator generates controllable laser frequency modulations and calibration phase delay modulations. These known calibration phase delays are used to gauge the sensor output in real time, correcting for signal variations due to operating point and optical power changes. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this calibration method.
